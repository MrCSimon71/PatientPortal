# Simple Patient Portal

We would like you to create a sample project that would allow a Dentist to update Patient records. Your project must have a back-end API, and a separate Web UI.

The API should demonstrate basic CRUD functionality to store and retrieve patient information within a database.
 - You may use a local database, a mocked database, or in-memory database, or you may use an Azure SQL database to store/retrieve data.
 - The API must require authentication (username and password), and the API endpoints must be secured behind the login.
 - The UI portion should allow a user to log in and call each of the CRUD endpoints on the API.

We are not evaluating what your UI actually looks like- don't expend effort on making it look "nice". Just call the endpoints using JS and display the results in a browser.

*Note:* Though we regularly work with both React and Angular, your UI does not need to use either of these.
